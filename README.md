# 5G Network Quality Prediction System

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning models to predict 5G network performance across different geographical zones, based on data features like carrier frequency, session continuity, handover success rate, and more. The predictions include performance scores, sector, and site IDs using pre-trained models for both performance and sector classification. The system is built using Flask for the backend and a responsive web interface for input and output visualization.

## Running Guide

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to Backend Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all the required Python libraries using `pip3`:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Flask Application**:
   Start the Flask app by executing:
   ```bash
   python3 flask_app.py
   ```

4. **Modify CORS Configuration**:
   Ensure that the Flask backend allows requests from the live web interface by modifying the `CORS` setup:
   ```python
   CORS(app, resources={r"/*": {"origins": ["<<Live IP Address>>"]}})
   ```
   Adjust the IP address or domain to the one where your frontend is hosted. If you are developing locally, use `http://127.0.0.1:5501` or `http://localhost:5000`.

5. **Modify Frontend to Send Requests to Flask Backend**:
   In the frontend code, update the `fetch` request URL to match your Flask backend IP address:
   ```javascript
   fetch('http://<<Your Flask Backend IP Address>>/predict', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
           'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       },
       body: JSON.stringify(inputData),
   })
   ```
   Replace `<<Your Flask Backend IP Address>>` with the actual address of your Flask server.

6. **Run Live Web**:
   Open the frontend HTML file in your browser or host it on a local server. Ensure the frontend makes requests to the Flask backend with the updated IP address.
